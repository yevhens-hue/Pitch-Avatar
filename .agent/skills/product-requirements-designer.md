# Product Requirements Designer

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "write a PRD", "generate product requirements", "create feature specifications", or "design feature requirements".

## Behavior

### Mode Selection

**Enterprise PRD**: Full cross-functional specification
- Complete problem analysis with market context
- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- Success metrics with measurement plans
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Full launch and rollout plan
- Stakeholder sign-off sections

**Lean PRD**: Hypothesis-driven one-pager
- Problem/opportunity statement
- Proposed solution with key assumptions
- MVP scope and success criteria
- Learning goals and experiment design
- Quick iteration plan
